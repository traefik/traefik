description: "Learn how to configure routing and load balancing in Traefik Proxy to reach Services, which handle incoming requests. Read the technical documentation."
--- 

A `TraefikService` is a custom resource that sits on top of the Kubernetes Services. It enables advanced load-balancing features such as a [Weighted Round Robin](#weighted-round-robin) load balancing or a [Mirroring](#mirroring) between your Kubernetes Services.

Services configure how to reach the actual endpoints that will eventually handle incoming requests. In Traefik, the target service can be either a standard [Kubernetes service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)—which exposes a pod—or a TraefikService. The latter allows you to combine advanced load-balancing options like:

- [Weighted Round Robin load balancing](#weighted-round-robin).
- [Mirroring](#mirroring). 

## Weighted Round Robin

The WRR is able to load balance the requests between multiple services based on weights. The WRR `TraefikService` allows you to load balance the traffic between Kubernetes Services and other instances of `TraefikService` (another WRR service -, or a mirroring service).

### Configuration Example

```yaml tab="IngressRoute"
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: test-name
  namespace: apps

spec:
  entryPoints:
  - websecure
  routes:
  - match: Host(`example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/foo`)
    kind: Rule
    services:
    # Set a WRR TraefikService
    - name: wrr1
      namespace: apps
      kind: TraefikService
  tls:
    # Add a TLS certificate from a Kubernetes Secret
    secretName: supersecret
```

```yaml tab="TraefikService WRR Level#1"
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: TraefikService
metadata:
  name: wrr1
  namespace: apps

spec:
  weighted:
    services:
        # Kubernetes Service
      - name: svc1
        namespace: apps
        port: 80
        weight: 1
        # Second level WRR service
      - name: wrr2
        namespace: apps
        kind: TraefikService
        weight: 1
        # Mirroring service
        # The service is described in the Mirroring example
      - name: mirror1
        namespace: apps
        kind: TraefikService
        weight: 1
```

```yaml tab="TraefikService WRR Level#2"
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: TraefikService
metadata:
  name: wrr2
  namespace: apps

spec:
  weighted:
    services:
      # Kubernetes Service
      - name: svc2
        namespace: apps
        port: 80
        weight: 1
      # Kubernetes Service
      - name: svc3
        namespace: apps
        port: 80
        weight: 1

```

#### Stickiness on multiple levels

When chaining or mixing load-balancers (e.g. a load-balancer of servers is one of the "children" of a load-balancer of services),
for stickiness to work all the way, the option needs to be specified at all required levels.
Which means the client needs to send a cookie with as many key/value pairs as there are sticky levels.

Sticky sessions, for stickiness to work all the way, must be specified at each load-balancing level.

For instance, in the example below, there is a first level of load-balancing because there is a (Weighted Round Robin) load-balancing of the two `whoami` services,
and there is a second level because each whoami service is a `replicaset` and is thus handled as a load-balancer of servers.

```yaml tab="IngressRoute"
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: ingressroutebar
  namespace: apps

spec:
  entryPoints:
  - web
  routes:
  - match: Host(`example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/foo`)
    kind: Rule
    services:
    - name: wrr1
      namespace: apps
      kind: TraefikService
```

```yaml tab="TraefikService WRR with 2 level of stickiness"
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: TraefikService
metadata:
  name: wrr1
  namespace: apps
  
spec:
  weighted:
    services:
    - name: whoami1
      kind: Service
      port: 80
      weight: 1
      # Stickiness level2 (on the Kubernetes service)
      sticky:
        cookie:
        name: lvl2
    - name: whoami2
      kind: Service
      weight: 1
      port: 80
      # Stickiness level2 (on the Kubernetes service)
      sticky:
        cookie:
        name: lvl2
  # Stickiness level2 (on the WRR service)
  sticky:
    cookie:
    name: lvl1
```

In the example above, to keep a session open with the same server, the client would then need to specify the two levels within the cookie for each request, e.g. with curl:

```bash
# Assuming `10.42.0.6` is the IP address of one of the replicas (a pod then) of the `whoami1` service.
curl -H Host:example.com -b "lvl1=default-whoami1-80; lvl2=http://10.42.0.6:80" http://localhost:8000/foo
```

## Mirroring

The mirroring is able to mirror requests sent to a service to other services.

A mirroring service allows you to send the trafiic to many services together:

- The **main** service receives 100% of the traffic,
- The **mirror** services receive a percentage of the traffic.

For example, to upgrade the version of your application. You can set the service that targets current version as the **main** service, and the service of the new version a **mirror** service.
Thus you can start testing the behavior of the new version keeping the current version reachable.

The mirroring `TraefikService` allows you to reference Kubernetes Services and other instances of `TraefikService` (another WRR service -, or a mirroring service).

Please note that by default the whole request is buffered in memory while it is being mirrored.
See the `maxBodySize` option in the example below for how to modify this behavior.
