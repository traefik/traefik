Traefikâ€™s TLS configuration defines how to handle TLS negotiation for incoming connections. TLS settings are primarily configured on routers, where you specify certificates and security options for secure communication..

When a router has to handle HTTPS traffic, it should be specified with a `tls` field of the router definition.

The next section of this documentation explains how to configure TLS connections through a definition in the dynamic configuration and how to configure TLS options, and certificates stores.
