                            The Kubernetes Service itself does load-balance to the pods.

                                FlushInterval defines the interval, in milliseconds, in between flushes to the client while copying the response body.
                                A negative value means to flush immediately after each write to the client.
                                This configuration is ignored when ReverseProxy recognizes a response as a streaming response;
                                for such responses, writes are flushed to the client immediately.
