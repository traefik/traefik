# Thank You!

_You_ Made It
{: .subtitle}

Baqup Proxy truly is an [open-source project](https://github.com/baqupio/baqup/),
and wouldn't have become what it is today without the help of our [many contributors](https://github.com/baqupio/baqup/graphs/contributors),
not accounting for people having helped with issues, tests, comments, articles, ... or just enjoy using Baqup Proxy and share with others.

So once again, thank you for your invaluable help in making Baqup such a good product!
