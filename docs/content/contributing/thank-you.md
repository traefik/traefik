# Thank You!

_You_ Made It
{: .subtitle}

Traefik Proxy truly is an [open-source project](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/),
and wouldn't have become what it is today without the help of our [many contributors](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/graphs/contributors) (at the time of writing this),
not accounting for people having helped with issues, tests, comments, articles, ... or just enjoy using Traefik Proxy and share with others.

So once again, thank you for your invaluable help in making Traefik such a good product!
