and teach others in the community how to best implement it.
It always sparks joy when users share how Traefik Proxy helps them solve their problems.

**Help community members!** Everyone needs a place to share their cool innovations or get help with that pesky bug that only a different pair of eyes seems to be able to see.
Join our [Community Forum](https://community.traefik.io/) where you can ask questions, help out other users, and share your neat configuration examples or snippets.
Top contributors will be asked to join the Ambassador program and get unique swag to celebrate!

**Build cool solutions!** Traefik Proxy would be so much better if only it hadâ€¦
We love all the wonderful ideas that our users come up with, but we can only build so much.
Luckily, as an open source community, our users can help by [building awesome features](https://github.com/orgs/traefik/projects/9/views/7), enhancements, or bug fixes.
We are a big community, so we do need to prioritize a bit.
That is why we use the tag `contributor/wanted` to let you know which pull requests will make it to the front of the queue for design support and review.
Feel free to grab one of these and run with it.
Top contributors get unique swag to celebrate.
