# Govern Your APIs with Traefik Hub

Traefik Hub transforms your API infrastructure by providing enterprise-grade API Gateway and comprehensive API Management capabilities. Built on the foundation of Traefik Proxy, Hub enables organizations to govern, secure, and manage APIs at scale across cloud-native environments.

## API Gateway and API Management Capabilities

Traefik Hub offers two complementary approaches to API governance:

- [Traefik Hub API Gateway](https://traefik.io/solutions/api-gateway/): Enterprise-grade security, distributed features, and advanced access control for cloud-native API gateway scenarios. It includes AI Gateway capabilities for modern machine learning workloads.

- [Traefik Hub API Management](https://traefik.io/solutions/api-management/): Comprehensive API lifecycle management, developer portals, and organizational features for teams managing multiple APIs across environments.

## API Management Features

Traefik Hub API Management provides a complete suite of features designed to streamline API governance and accelerate developer productivity:

### Comprehensive API Lifecycle Management

- **Centralized API Catalog**: Comprehensive API inventory providing real-time visibility and control
- **Advanced Versioning**: Utilize the most flexible API versioning and Kubernetes-native labels to logically organize APIs, track their evolution over time, and avoid breaking changes for client applications
- **Quality Control**: Perform error checks and change impact analysis with Traefik Hub's static analyzer to ensure compliance and prevent misconfiguration by catching errors early
- **Resource Management**: Centralize rate limits, quotas, and policy enforcement across groups of APIs through Plans & Bundles, ensuring consistent and efficient resource management
- **Subscription Management**: Create managed and self-serve subscriptions for enhanced ease-of-use, security, and auditability
- **Standards Compliance**: Import, validate, and manage APIs using industry-standard OpenAPI specifications

### Developer Experience & Self-Service

- **Customizable Portals**: Easily create one or more dedicated API Portals for developers to discover, understand, and interact with your APIs
- **Interactive API Testing**: Allow developers to test APIs directly within the portal for immediate feedback
- **Branded Experience**: Customize the API portal to house API documentation, clear integration instructions, and personalized content to foster adoption and streamline development
- **Credential Management**: Generate API access credentials, such as API keys, directly from the portal for simplified access and secure integration
- **Auto-generated Documentation**: Automatically generated, interactive API documentation from OpenAPI specifications in the portal

### Enterprise-Grade Security

- **Access Control**: Implement fine-grained permissions through detailed API policies and JWT inspection to secure access to API resources
- **Identity Integration**: Leverage existing identity and access management (IAM) solutions, such as Keycloak, Okta, Auth0, etc. through industry-standard authentication protocols, including native OIDC support
- **Data Protection**: Advanced TLS management, supporting Let's Encrypt (ACME) and SPIFFE for robust data protection
- **Threat Prevention**: Native Web Application Firewall (WAF) powered by OWASP Coraza to defend against known vulnerabilities

### Observability

- **Open Standards Monitoring**: Gain deep insights into API health and performance with OpenTelemetry integration to provide metrics and tracing capabilities without vendor lock-in
- **Third-party Integrations**: Turnkey integration with Treblle directly on the Traefik Hub Dashboard for real-time, out-of-the-box observability without maintaining a complex monitoring infrastructure
- **Pre-built Grafana Dashboards**: Ready-to-use monitoring dashboards with key API metrics and performance indicators
