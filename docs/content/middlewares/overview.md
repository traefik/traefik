# Middlewares

Tweaking the Request
{: .subtitle }

![Overview](../assets/img/middleware/overview.png)

Attached to the routers, pieces of middleware are a means of tweaking the requests before they are sent to your [service](../routing/services/index.md) (or before the answer from the services are sent to the clients).

There are several available middleware in Traefik, some can modify the request, the headers, some are in charge of redirections, some add authentication, and so on.

Middlewares that use the same protocol can be combined into chains to fit every scenario.

!!! warning "Provider Namespace"

    Be aware of the concept of Providers Namespace described in the [Configuration Discovery](../providers/overview.md#provider-namespace) section.
    It also applies to Middlewares.

## Configuration Example

```yaml tab="Docker"
# As a Docker Label
whoami:
  #  A container that exposes an API to show its IP address
  image: traefik/whoami
  labels:
    # Create a middleware named `foo-add-prefix`
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.foo-add-prefix.addprefix.prefix=/foo"
    # Apply the middleware named `foo-add-prefix` to the router named `router1`
    - "traefik.http.routers.router1.middlewares=foo-add-prefix@docker"
```

```yaml tab="Kubernetes IngressRoute"
---
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: stripprefix
spec:
  stripPrefix:
    prefixes:
      - /stripit

apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: ingressroute
spec:
# more fields...
  routes:
    # more fields...
    middlewares:
      - name: stripprefix
```

```yaml tab="Consul Catalog"
# Create a middleware named `foo-add-prefix`
- "traefik.http.middlewares.foo-add-prefix.addprefix.prefix=/foo"
# Apply the middleware named `foo-add-prefix` to the router named `router1`
- "traefik.http.routers.router1.middlewares=foo-add-prefix@consulcatalog"
```

```json tab="Marathon"
"labels": {
  "traefik.http.middlewares.foo-add-prefix.addprefix.prefix": "/foo",
  "traefik.http.routers.router1.middlewares": "foo-add-prefix@marathon"
}
```

```yaml tab="Rancher"
# As a Rancher Label
labels:
  # Create a middleware named `foo-add-prefix`
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.foo-add-prefix.addprefix.prefix=/foo"
  # Apply the middleware named `foo-add-prefix` to the router named `router1`
  - "traefik.http.routers.router1.middlewares=foo-add-prefix@rancher"
```

```yaml tab="File (YAML)"
# As YAML Configuration File
http:
  routers:
    router1:
      service: myService
      middlewares:
        - "foo-add-prefix"
      rule: "Host(`example.com`)"

  middlewares:
    foo-add-prefix:
      addPrefix:
        prefix: "/foo"

  services:
    service1:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://127.0.0.1:80"
```

```toml tab="File (TOML)"
# As TOML Configuration File
[http.routers]
  [http.routers.router1]
    service = "myService"
    middlewares = ["foo-add-prefix"]
    rule = "Host(`example.com`)"

[http.middlewares]
  [http.middlewares.foo-add-prefix.addPrefix]
    prefix = "/foo"

[http.services]
  [http.services.service1]
    [http.services.service1.loadBalancer]

      [[http.services.service1.loadBalancer.servers]]
        url = "http://127.0.0.1:80"
```
