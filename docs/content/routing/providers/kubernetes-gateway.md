## Routing Configuration

### Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

* You can find an exhaustive list, of the custom resources and their attributes in
[the reference page](../../reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-gateway.md) or in the Kubernetes Sigs `Gateway API` [repository](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api).
* Validate that [the prerequisites](../../providers/kubernetes-gateway.md#configuration-requirements) are fulfilled before using the Traefik Kubernetes Gateway Provider.
    
You can find an excerpt of the supported Kubernetes Gateway API resources in the table below:

| Kind                               | Purpose                                                                   | Concept Behind                                                              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [GatewayClass](#kind-gatewayclass) | Defines a set of Gateways that share a common configuration and behaviour | [GatewayClass](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha1/api-types/gatewayclass)  |
| [Gateway](#kind-gateway)           | Describes how traffic can be translated to Services within the cluster    | [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha1/api-types/gateway)            |
| [HTTPRoute](#kind-httproute)       | HTTP rules for mapping requests from a Gateway to Kubernetes Services     | [Route](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha1/api-types/httproute)      |

### Kind: `GatewayClass`

`GatewayClass` is cluster-scoped resource defined by the infrastructure provider. This resource represents a class of Gateways that can be instantiated.
More details on the GatewayClass [official documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha1/api-types/gatewayclass/).

The `GatewayClass` should be declared by the infrastructure provider, otherwise please register the `GatewayClass`
[definition](../../reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-gateway.md#definitions) in the Kubernetes cluster before 
creating `GatewayClass` objects.

!!! info "Declaring GatewayClass"

    ```yaml
    kind: GatewayClass
    apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
    metadata:
      name: my-gateway-class
    spec:
      # Controller is a domain/path string that indicates
      # the controller that is managing Gateways of this class.
      controller: traefik.io/gateway-controller
    ```

### Kind: `Gateway`

A `Gateway` is 1:1 with the life cycle of the configuration of infrastructure. When a user creates a Gateway, 
some load balancing infrastructure is provisioned or configured by the GatewayClass controller. 
More details on the Gateway [official documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha1/api-types/gateway/).

Register the `Gateway` [definition](../../reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-gateway.md#definitions) in the
Kubernetes cluster before creating `Gateway` objects.
