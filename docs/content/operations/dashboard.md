# The Dashboard

See What's Going On
{: .subtitle }

The dashboard is the central place that shows you the current active routes handled by Traefik.

The dashboard is available at the same location as the [API](./api.md) but on the path `/dashboard/` by default.

!!! warning "The trailing slash `/` in `/dashboard/` is mandatory"

There are 2 ways to configure and access the dashboard:

- [Secure mode (Recommended)](#secure-mode)
- [Insecure mode](#insecure-mode)

!!! note ""
    There is also a redirect of the path `/` to the path `/dashboard/`,
    but one should not rely on that property as it is bound to change,
    and it might make for confusing routing rules anyway.

## Secure Mode

This is the **recommended** method.

Start by enabling the dashboard by using the following option from [Traefik's API](./api.md)
on the [static configuration](../getting-started/configuration-overview.md#the-static-configuration):

```yaml tab="File (YAML)"
api:
  # Dashboard
  #
  # Optional
  # Default: true
  #
  dashboard: true
```

```toml tab="File (TOML)"
[api]
  # Dashboard
  #
  # Optional
  # Default: true
  #
  dashboard = true
```

```bash tab="CLI"
# Dashboard
#
# Optional
# Default: true
#
--api.dashboard=true
```

Then define a routing configuration on Traefik itself,
with a router attached to the service `api@internal` in the
[dynamic configuration](../getting-started/configuration-overview.md#the-dynamic-configuration),
to allow defining:

- One or more security features through [middlewares](../middlewares/overview.md)
  like authentication ([basicAuth](../middlewares/http/basicauth.md) , [digestAuth](../middlewares/http/digestauth.md),
  [forwardAuth](../middlewares/http/forwardauth.md)) or [whitelisting](../middlewares/http/ipwhitelist.md).

- A [router rule](#dashboard-router-rule) for accessing the dashboard,
  through Traefik itself (sometimes referred as "Traefik-ception").

### Dashboard Router Rule

As underlined in the [documentation for the `api.dashboard` option](./api.md#dashboard),
the [router rule](../routing/routers/index.md#rule) defined for Traefik must match
the path prefixes `/api` and `/dashboard`.

We recommend to use a "Host Based rule" as ```Host(`traefik.example.com`)``` to match everything on the host domain,
or to make sure that the defined rule captures both prefixes:

```bash tab="Host Rule"
# The dashboard can be accessed on http://traefik.example.com/dashboard/
rule = "Host(`traefik.example.com`)"
```

```bash tab="Path Prefix Rule"
# The dashboard can be accessed on http://example.com/dashboard/ or http://traefik.example.com/dashboard/
rule = "PathPrefix(`/api`, `/dashboard`)"
```

```bash tab="Combination of Rules"
# The dashboard can be accessed on http://traefik.example.com/dashboard/
rule = "Host(`traefik.example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/api`, `/dashboard`)"
```

## Insecure Mode

This mode is not recommended because it does not allow the use of security features.

To enable the "insecure mode", use the following options from [Traefik's API](./api.md#insecure):

```yaml tab="File (YAML)"
api:
  dashboard: true
  insecure: true
```

```toml tab="File (TOML)"
[api]
  dashboard = true
  insecure = true
```

```bash tab="CLI"
--api.dashboard=true --api.insecure=true
```

You can now access the dashboard on the port `8080` of the Traefik instance,
at the following URL: `http://<Traefik IP>:8080/dashboard/` (trailing slash is mandatory).
