# SPIFFE

Secure the backend connection with SPIFFE.
{: .subtitle }

[SPIFFE](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spiffe-about/overview/) (Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone), 
provides a secure identity in the form of a specially crafted X.509 certificate, 
to every workload in an environment.

Traefik is able to connect to the Workload API to obtain an x509-SVID used to secure the connection with SPIFFE enabled backends.

## Configuration

### General

Enabling SPIFFE is part of the [static configuration](../getting-started/configuration-overview.md#the-static-configuration).
It can be defined by using a file (YAML or TOML) or CLI arguments.

### Workload API

The `workloadAPIAddr` configuration defines the address of the SPIFFE [Workload API](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spiffe-about/spiffe-concepts/#spiffe-workload-api).

!!! info "Enabling SPIFFE in ServersTransports"

    Enabling SPIFFE does not imply that backend connections are going to use it automatically.
    Each [ServersTransport](../routing/services/index.md#serverstransport_1) that is meant to be secured with SPIFFE must [explicitly](../routing/services/index.md#spiffe) enable it.

!!! warning "SPIFFE can cause Traefik to stall"
	When using SPIFFE,
	Traefik will wait for the first SVID to be delivered before starting.
	If Traefik is hanging when waiting on SPIFFE SVID delivery,
	please double check that it is correctly registered as workload in your SPIFFE infrastructure.
