# Migration: Steps needed between the versions

## v3.0 to v3.1

### Kubernetes Provider RBACs

Starting with v3.1, the Kubernetes Providers now use the [EndpointSlices API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/) (Kubernetes >=v1.21) to discover service endpoint addresses.

Therefore, in the corresponding RBACs (see [KubernetesIngress](../routing/providers/kubernetes-ingress.md#configuration-example), [KubernetesCRD](../reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-crd.md#rbac), and [KubernetesGateway](../reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-gateway.md#rbac) provider RBACs), 
the `endpoints` right has to be removed and the following `endpointslices` right has to be added.

```yaml
  ... 
  - apiGroups:
      - discovery.k8s.io
    resources:
      - endpointslices
    verbs:
      - list
      - watch
  ...
```
