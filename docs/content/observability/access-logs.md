# Access Logs

Who Calls Whom?
{.subtitle}

By default, logs are written to stdout, in text format.

## Configuration

To enable the access logs:

```yaml tab="File (YAML)"
accessLog: {}
```

```toml tab="File (TOML)"
[accessLog]
```

```bash tab="CLI"
--accesslog=true
```

### `filePath`

By default access logs are written to the standard output.
To write the logs into a log file, use the `filePath` option.

```yaml tab="File (YAML)"
accessLog:
  filePath: "/path/to/access.log"
```

```toml tab="File (TOML)"
[accessLog]
  filePath = "/path/to/access.log"
```

```bash tab="CLI"
--accesslog.filepath=/path/to/access.log
```

### `format`

By default, logs are written using the Common Log Format (CLF).
To write logs in JSON, use `json` in the `format` option.
If the given format is unsupported, the default (CLF) is used instead.

!!! info "Common Log Format"

    ```html
    <remote_IP_address> - <client_user_name_if_available> [<timestamp>] "<request_method> <request_path> <request_protocol>" <origin_server_HTTP_status> <origin_server_content_size> "<request_referrer>" "<request_user_agent>" <number_of_requests_received_since_Traefik_started> "<Traefik_router_name>" "<Traefik_server_URL>" <request_duration_in_ms>ms
    ```

### `bufferingSize`

To write the logs in an asynchronous fashion, specify a  `bufferingSize` option.
This option represents the number of log lines Traefik will keep in memory before writing them to the selected output.
In some cases, this option can greatly help performances.

```yaml tab="File (YAML)"
# Configuring a buffer of 100 lines
accessLog:
  filePath: "/path/to/access.log"
  bufferingSize: 100
```

```toml tab="File (TOML)"
# Configuring a buffer of 100 lines
[accessLog]
  filePath = "/path/to/access.log"
  bufferingSize = 100
```

```bash tab="CLI"
# Configuring a buffer of 100 lines
--accesslog.filepath=/path/to/access.log
--accesslog.bufferingsize=100
```

### Filtering

To filter logs, you can specify a set of filters which are logically "OR-connected".
Thus, specifying multiple filters will keep more access logs than specifying only one.

The available filters are:

- `statusCodes`, to limit the access logs to requests with a status codes in the specified range
- `retryAttempts`, to keep the access logs when at least one retry has happened
- `minDuration`, to keep access logs when requests take longer than the specified duration (provided in seconds or as a valid duration format, see [time.ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration))

```yaml tab="File (YAML)"
# Configuring Multiple Filters
accessLog:
  filePath: "/path/to/access.log"
  format: json
  filters:
    statusCodes:
      - "200"
      - "300-302"
    retryAttempts: true
    minDuration: "10ms"
```

```toml tab="File (TOML)"
# Configuring Multiple Filters
[accessLog]
  filePath = "/path/to/access.log"
  format = "json"

  [accessLog.filters]
    statusCodes = ["200", "300-302"]
    retryAttempts = true
    minDuration = "10ms"
```

```bash tab="CLI"
# Configuring Multiple Filters
--accesslog.filepath=/path/to/access.log
--accesslog.format=json
--accesslog.filters.statuscodes=200,300-302
--accesslog.filters.retryattempts
--accesslog.filters.minduration=10ms
```

### Limiting the Fields/Including Headers

You can decide to limit the logged fields/headers to a given list with the `fields.names` and `fields.headers` options.

Each field can be set to:

- `keep` to keep the value
- `drop` to drop the value
- `redact` to replace the value with "redacted"

The `defaultMode` for `fields.names` is `keep`.

The `defaultMode` for `fields.headers` is `drop`.

```yaml tab="File (YAML)"
# Limiting the Logs to Specific Fields
accessLog:
  filePath: "/path/to/access.log"
  format: json
  fields:
    defaultMode: keep
    names:
      ClientUsername: drop
    headers:
      defaultMode: keep
      names:
        User-Agent: redact
        Authorization: drop
        Content-Type: keep
```

```toml tab="File (TOML)"
# Limiting the Logs to Specific Fields
[accessLog]
  filePath = "/path/to/access.log"
  format = "json"

  [accessLog.fields]
    defaultMode = "keep"
    
    [accessLog.fields.names]
      "ClientUsername" = "drop"

    [accessLog.fields.headers]
      defaultMode = "keep"

      [accessLog.fields.headers.names]
        "User-Agent" = "redact"
        "Authorization" = "drop"
        "Content-Type" = "keep"
```

```bash tab="CLI"
# Limiting the Logs to Specific Fields
--accesslog.filepath=/path/to/access.log
--accesslog.format=json
--accesslog.fields.defaultmode=keep
--accesslog.fields.names.ClientUsername=drop
--accesslog.fields.headers.defaultmode=keep
--accesslog.fields.headers.names.User-Agent=redact
--accesslog.fields.headers.names.Authorization=drop
--accesslog.fields.headers.names.Content-Type=keep
```

## Log Rotation

Traefik will close and reopen its log files, assuming they're configured, on receipt of a USR1 signal.
This allows the logs to be rotated and processed by an external program, such as `logrotate`.

!!! warning
    This does not work on Windows due to the lack of USR signals.

## Time Zones

Traefik will timestamp each log line in UTC time by default.

It is possible to configure the Traefik to timestamp in a specific timezone by ensuring the following configuration has been made in your environment:

1. Provide time zone data to `/etc/localtime` or `/usr/share/zoneinfo` (based on your distribution) or set the environment variable TZ to the desired timezone
2. Specify the field `StartLocal` by dropping the field named `StartUTC` (available on the default Common Log Format (CLF) as well as JSON)

Example utilizing Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.10
    environment:
      - TZ=US/Alaska
    command:
      - --accesslog.fields.names.StartUTC=drop
      - --providers.docker
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```
