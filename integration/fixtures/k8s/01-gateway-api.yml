Matching precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria: \n * The most specific match. For example, the most specific HTTPRoute match   is determined by the longest matching combination of hostname and path. * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with   a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over   a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\". * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in   alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence.

Invalid portions of a Route can be ignored (sometimes that will mean the full Route).
