          user for creating Gateway resources. \n It is recommended that this resource
          be used as a template for Gateways. This means that a Gateway is based on
          the state of the GatewayClass at the time it was created and changes to
          the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not propagated down to existing
          Gateways. This recommendation is intended to limit the blast radius of changes
          to GatewayClass or associated parameters. If implementations choose to propagate
          GatewayClass changes to existing Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented
          by the implementation. \n Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass,
          implementations MUST add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io`
          finalizer on the associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass
          associated with a Gateway is not deleted while in use. \n GatewayClass is
          a Cluster level resource."

                  correct set of Routes. The incoming hostname MUST be matched using
                  the Hostname field for each Listener in order of most to least specific.
                  That is, exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches.
                  \n If this field specifies multiple Listeners that have the same
                  Port value but are not compatible, the implementation must raise

                                    in behavior across multiple   implementations
                                    will be considered for inclusion in extended or
                                    core   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration
                                    for such filters   is specified using the ExtensionRef
                                    field. `Type` should be set to   \"ExtensionRef\"
                                    for custom filters. \n Implementers are encouraged
                                    to define custom implementation types to extend
                                    the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                        is satisfied. \n For example, take the following matches configuration:
                        \n ``` matches: - path:     value: \"/foo\"   headers:   -
                        name: \"version\"     value: \"v2\" - path:     value: \"/v2/foo\"

                        how to specify multiple match conditions that should be ANDed

                        prefix path match on \"/\", which has the effect of matching
                        every HTTP request. \n Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration

                        * Query param matches. \n If ties still exist across multiple
                        Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of
                        the following criteria, continuing on ties: \n * The oldest

                        in alphabetical order by   \"<namespace>/<name>\". \n If ties
                        still exist within the Route that has been given precedence,
                        matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching
                        rule meeting the above criteria."
