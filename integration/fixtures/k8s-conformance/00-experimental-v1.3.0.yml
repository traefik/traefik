                    Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                    each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                    the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                    appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.
                    
                    Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                    an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                    which to namespace this status.
                    
                    Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                    the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                    use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                    that they are responsible for.
                    
                    Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                    MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                    and ControllerName fields combined.
                    
                    A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.
                    
                    If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                    Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                    on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                    here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                    additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                    the BackendTLSPolicy.

                      PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                      associated Ancestor.
                      
                      Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                      in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                      Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                      the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                      useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                      SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                      have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
                      
                      In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                      resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                      targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
                      
                      Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                      ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                      Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                      implementations.
                      
                      For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                      used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                      In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                      ancestor object referred to in this status.
                      
                      Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                      relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.
                      
                      This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                      with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

            GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
            Gateway resources.
            
            It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
            means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
            was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
            propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
            limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
            If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
            Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.
            
            Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
            add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
            associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
            Gateway is not deleted while in use.
            
            GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.

            GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
            Gateway resources.
            
            It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
            means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
            was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
            propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
            limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
            If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
            Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.
            
            Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
            add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
            associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
            Gateway is not deleted while in use.
            
            GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.

                    it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in

                    Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)

                    exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
                    "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                    from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
                    apply in that case).
                    
                    Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
                    combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
                    
                    Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
                    Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects

                    "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
                    
                    **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
                    Listener**.
                    
                    When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
                    example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
                    can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
                    Listener fields.
                    
                    When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
                    each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
                    values for other fields.
                    
                    The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
                    The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
                    Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
                    Gateway API spec.
                    
                    The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
                    values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:
                    
                    * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
                    * **TCP, UDP**: Port
                    
                    One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
                    implementation:
                    
                    * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
                      Listeners, and
                    * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
                      Protocol.
                    
                    In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
                    TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.
                    
                    If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
                    previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
                    accepted.
                    
                    Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
                    Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.
                    
                    ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname
                    
                    When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
                    hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
                    values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
                    
                    Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
                    matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
                    matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
                    `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
                    
                    Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
                    wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
                    For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
                    
                    The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
                    hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
                    
                    The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
                    the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
                    `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
                    
                    ## Handling indistinct Listeners
                    
                    If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
                    Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
                    condition in the Listener Status to "True".
                    
                    The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
                    purpose of this documentation.
                    
                    Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
                    Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
                    no Conflicted Listeners.
                    
                    Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
                    the following rules:
                    
                    * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
                      ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
                    * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
                      contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.
                    
                    The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
                    Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
                    not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
                    indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
                    Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
                    indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
                    
                    ## General Listener behavior
                    
                    Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
                    For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
                    request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
                    to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
                    
                    This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
                    of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
                    clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
                    `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.
                    
                    Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
                    for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
                    conformance tests.
                    
                    ## Compatible Listeners
                    
                    A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:
                    
                    1. They are distinct.
                    2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
                       requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
                       addresses.
                    
                    Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
                    implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
                    may not be compatible for another.
                    
                    For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
                    on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
                    would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
                    
                    Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
                    Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.
                    
                    In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

                          present.
                          
                          Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                          may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria:
                          
                          * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                            a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                            a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                          * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                            alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                            example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.
                          
                          All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                          implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                          the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                          support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                          example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                          of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                                        A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                                        relates the key and values.

                          Hostname specifies the virtual hostname to match for protocol types that
                          define this concept. When unspecified, all hostnames are matched. This
                          field is ignored for protocols that don't require hostname based
                          matching.
                          
                          Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                          the following protocols:
                          
                          * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                          * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                          * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match both the SNI and Host header.
                            Note that this does not require the SNI and Host header to be the same.
                            The semantics of this are described in more detail below.
                          
                          To ensure security, Section 11.1 of RFC-6066 emphasizes that server
                          implementations that rely on SNI hostname matching MUST also verify
                          hostnames within the application protocol.
                          
                          Section 9.1.2 of RFC-7540 provides a mechanism for servers to reject the
                          reuse of a connection by responding with the HTTP 421 Misdirected Request
                          status code. This indicates that the origin server has rejected the
                          request because it appears to have been misdirected.
                          
                          To detect misdirected requests, Gateways SHOULD match the authority of
                          the requests with all the SNI hostname(s) configured across all the
                          Gateway Listeners on the same port and protocol:
                          
                          * If another Listener has an exact match or more specific wildcard entry,
                            the Gateway SHOULD return a 421.
                          * If the current Listener (selected by SNI matching during ClientHello)
                            does not match the Host:
                              * If another Listener does match the Host the Gateway SHOULD return a
                                421.
                              * If no other Listener matches the Host, the Gateway MUST return a
                                404.
                          
                          For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                          `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                          there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                          accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                          documentation.
                          
                          Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                          as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                          both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                          Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                          combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                          and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                          a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                          AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                          resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                          attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                          Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact
                          successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                          for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully
                          attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions.
                          
                          Uses for this field include troubleshooting Route attachment and
                          measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.

                    This could be the IP address or hostname of an external load balancer or
                    other networking infrastructure, or some other address that traffic will

                    If no Addresses are specified, the implementation MAY schedule the
                    Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
                    set of Addresses.
                    
                    The implementation MUST bind all Listeners to every GatewayAddress that
                    it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in
                    GatewayStatus.Addresses.

                    Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define
                    logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.
                    At least one Listener MUST be specified.
                    
                    ## Distinct Listeners
                    
                    Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
                    MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
                    exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
                    "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                    from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
                    apply in that case).
                    
                    Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
                    combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
                    
                    Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
                    Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
                    they support:
                    
                    HTTPRoute
                    
                    1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
                    2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
                    
                    TLSRoute
                    
                    1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough
                    
                    "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
                    
                    **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
                    Listener**.
                    
                    When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
                    example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
                    can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
                    Listener fields.
                    
                    When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
                    each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
                    values for other fields.
                    
                    The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
                    The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
                    Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
                    Gateway API spec.
                    
                    The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
                    values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:
                    
                    * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
                    * **TCP, UDP**: Port
                    
                    One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
                    implementation:
                    
                    * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
                      Listeners, and
                    * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
                      Protocol.
                    
                    In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
                    TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.
                    
                    If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
                    previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
                    accepted.
                    
                    Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
                    Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.
                    
                    ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname
                    
                    When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
                    hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
                    values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
                    
                    Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
                    matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
                    matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
                    `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
                    
                    Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
                    wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
                    For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
                    
                    The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
                    hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
                    
                    The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
                    the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
                    `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
                    
                    ## Handling indistinct Listeners
                    
                    If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
                    Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
                    condition in the Listener Status to "True".
                    
                    The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
                    purpose of this documentation.
                    
                    Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
                    Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
                    no Conflicted Listeners.
                    
                    Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
                    the following rules:
                    
                    * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
                      ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
                    * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
                      contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.
                    
                    The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
                    Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
                    not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
                    indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
                    Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
                    indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
                    
                    ## General Listener behavior
                    
                    Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
                    For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
                    request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
                    to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
                    
                    This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
                    of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
                    clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
                    `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.
                    
                    Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
                    for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
                    conformance tests.
                    
                    ## Compatible Listeners
                    
                    A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:
                    
                    1. They are distinct.
                    2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
                       requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
                       addresses.
                    
                    Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
                    implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
                    may not be compatible for another.
                    
                    For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
                    on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
                    would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
                    
                    Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
                    Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.
                    
                    In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.

                          present.
                          
                          Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                          may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria:
                          
                          * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                            a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                            a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                          * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                            alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                            example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.
                          
                          All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                          implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                          the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                          support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                          example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                          of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                        description: |-
                          Hostname specifies the virtual hostname to match for protocol types that
                          define this concept. When unspecified, all hostnames are matched. This
                          field is ignored for protocols that don't require hostname based
                          matching.
                          
                          Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                          the following protocols:
                          
                          * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                          * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                          * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match both the SNI and Host header.
                            Note that this does not require the SNI and Host header to be the same.
                            The semantics of this are described in more detail below.
                          
                          To ensure security, Section 11.1 of RFC-6066 emphasizes that server
                          implementations that rely on SNI hostname matching MUST also verify
                          hostnames within the application protocol.
                          
                          Section 9.1.2 of RFC-7540 provides a mechanism for servers to reject the
                          reuse of a connection by responding with the HTTP 421 Misdirected Request
                          status code. This indicates that the origin server has rejected the
                          request because it appears to have been misdirected.
                          
                          To detect misdirected requests, Gateways SHOULD match the authority of
                          the requests with all the SNI hostname(s) configured across all the
                          Gateway Listeners on the same port and protocol:
                          
                          * If another Listener has an exact match or more specific wildcard entry,
                            the Gateway SHOULD return a 421.
                          * If the current Listener (selected by SNI matching during ClientHello)
                            does not match the Host:
                              * If another Listener does match the Host the Gateway SHOULD return a
                                421.
                              * If no other Listener matches the Host, the Gateway MUST return a
                                404.
                          
                          For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                          `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                          there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                          accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                          documentation.
                          
                          Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                          as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                          both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                    Implementations should prefer to express Gateway conditions
                    using the `GatewayConditionType` and `GatewayConditionReason`
                    constants so that operators and tools can converge on a common
                    vocabulary to describe Gateway state.
                    
                    Known condition types are:

                          Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                          combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                          and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                          a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                          AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                          resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                          attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                          Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact
                          successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                          for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully
                          attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions.
                          
                          Uses for this field include troubleshooting Route attachment and
                          measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.

            GRPCRoute provides a way to route gRPC requests. This includes the capability
            to match requests by hostname, gRPC service, gRPC method, or HTTP/2 header.
            Filters can be used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify
            where matching requests will be routed.
            
            GRPCRoute falls under extended support within the Gateway API. Within the
            following specification, the word "MUST" indicates that an implementation

            implementation not supporting this route type need not follow the requirement
            unless explicitly indicated.
            
            Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTPS` `ProtocolType` MUST

            ALPN. If the implementation does not support this, then it MUST set the
            "Accepted" condition to "False" for the affected listener with a reason of
            "UnsupportedProtocol".  Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections
            with an upgrade from HTTP/1.
            
            Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTP` `ProtocolType` MUST
            support HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP (h2c,
            https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.1) without an initial
            upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. with prior knowledge
            (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.4). If the implementation
            does not support this, then it MUST set the "Accepted" condition to "False"
            for the affected listener with a reason of "UnsupportedProtocol".
            Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections with an upgrade from
            HTTP/1, i.e. without prior knowledge.

                    Hostnames defines a set of hostnames to match against the GRPC
                    Host header to select a GRPCRoute to process the request. This matches
                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:
                    
                    1. IPs are not allowed.
                    2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                       label MUST appear by itself as the first label.
                    
                    If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and GRPCRoute, there
                    MUST be at least one intersecting hostname for the GRPCRoute to be
                    attached to the Listener. For example:
                    
                    * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                      least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                    * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                      one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                      `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match. On the other
                      hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.
                    
                    Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                    as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                    both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
                    
                    If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any
                    GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                    ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                    GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                    `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.
                    
                    If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                    match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by
                    the implementation. The implementation MUST raise an 'Accepted' Condition
                    with a status of `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
                    
                    If a Route (A) of type HTTPRoute or GRPCRoute is attached to a
                    Listener and that listener already has another Route (B) of the other
                    type attached and the intersection of the hostnames of A and B is
                    non-empty, then the implementation MUST accept exactly one of these two
                    routes, determined by the following criteria, in order:
                    
                    * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                    * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                      "{namespace}/{name}".
                    
                    The rejected Route MUST raise an 'Accepted' condition with a status of
                    'False' in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.
                    
                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
                    
                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
                    
                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.
                    
                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
                    
                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                    
                    Some examples:
                    
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
                    
                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.
                    
                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
                    
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.
                          
                          
                          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                          Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                          the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.
                          
                          
                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                          document how/if Port is interpreted.
                          
                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                          following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:
                          
                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                          both specified values.
                          * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                          both specified values.
                          
                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                          interpreted.
                          
                          When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                          least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                          the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                          Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                      GRPCRouteRule defines the semantics for matching a gRPC request based on
                      conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
                      an API object (backendRefs).

                        description: |-
                          BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be
                          sent.
                          
                          Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                          how many are invalid.
                          
                          If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                          specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                          receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.
                          
                          See the GRPCBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                          GRPCBackendRef invalid.
                          
                          When a GRPCBackendRef is invalid, `UNAVAILABLE` statuses MUST be returned for
                          requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                          multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                          requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                          MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.
                          
                          For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                          invalid, 50 percent of traffic MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.
                          Implementations may choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                            When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                            honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.
                            
                            Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes

                            If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                            backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                            protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.
                            
                            If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                            "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                      Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                      types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                      
                                      - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                        implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.
                                      
                                      - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                        are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                      
                                      - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                                        In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                        implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                        conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                        is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to
                                        "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                      
                                      Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                      extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                      
                                      If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                      MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                      that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                          The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
                          This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.
                          
                          Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:
                          
                          - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations that support
                            GRPCRoute.
                          - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                          - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                            implementations.
                          
                          Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                          indicated in the filter.
                          
                          If an implementation cannot support a combination of filters, it must clearly
                          document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                          filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                          `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                          this configuration error.

                                Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                
                                - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                  implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.
                                
                                - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                  are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                
                                - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                                  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to
                                  "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                
                                Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                
                                If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                          There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                          due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:
                          
                          * The Route refers to a nonexistent parent.
                          * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.
                          * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.

                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

            HTTPRoute provides a way to route HTTP requests. This includes the capability
            to match requests by hostname, path, header, or query param. Filters can be
            used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify where matching
            requests should be routed.

                  description: |-
                    Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host
                    header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations
                    MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while
                    performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
                    configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.
                    
                    Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
                    hostname with 2 notable exceptions:
                    
                    1. IPs are not allowed.
                    2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                       label must appear by itself as the first label.
                    
                    If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
                    must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
                    attached to the Listener. For example:
                    
                    * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                      least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                    * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                      one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                      `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
                      all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                      not match.
                    
                    Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                    as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                    both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
                    
                    If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
                    HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                    ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                    HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                    `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.
                    
                    If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                    match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
                    implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                    `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
                    
                    In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
                    overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
                    be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:
                    
                    * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                    * Characters in a matching hostname.
                    
                    If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for
                    HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.
                    
                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
                    
                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
                    
                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.
                    
                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
                    
                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                    
                    Some examples:
                    
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
                    
                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.
                    
                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
                    
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.
                          
                          
                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                          routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                          any namespace to the Service.
                          
                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.

                          Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                          differently based on the type of parent resource.

                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          sent.
                          
                          Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                          how many are invalid.
                          
                          If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                          specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                          receive a 500 status code.
                          
                          See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                          HTTPBackendRef invalid.
                          
                          When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                          requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                          multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                          requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                          MUST receive a 500 status code.
                          
                          For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                          invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
                          choose how that 50 percent is determined.
                          
                          When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready endpoints,
                          implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend instead.
                          If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above rules for 500 responses
                          MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.

                                          from all `Origin`s are allowed.
                                          
                                          When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                          means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                          `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                          the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                          client.
                                          
                                          The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                          always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).
                                          
                                          If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                          the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                          cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                          403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                          the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                          Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.
                                          
                                          The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                          wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.
                                          
                                          When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowOrigins` field
                                          specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                                          in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                                          instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                                          the client.

                                          A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                                          that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                                          The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
                                          `Cache-Control`
                                          `Content-Language`

                                          The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.
                                          
                                          When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,

                                          A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
                                          to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
                                          use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is
                                          unspecified.

                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                              
                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                      Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                      types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                      
                                      - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                        implementations must support core filters.
                                      
                                      - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                        are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                      
                                      - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                        specific vendors.
                                        In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                        implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                        conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                        is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                        "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                      
                                      Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                      extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                      
                                      If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                      MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                      that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.
                                      
                                      Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                      must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.
                                      
                                      Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                      Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                      Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.

                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                              
                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                              
                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                          Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                          this rule.
                          
                          Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
                          they are specified.
                          
                          Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
                          any combination or order of filters that cannot be supported. If implementations
                          choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
                          that behavior.
                          
                          To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
                          consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
                          in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
                          a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
                          "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.
                          
                          Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:
                          
                          - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                          - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                          - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                            implementations.
                          
                          Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                          indicated in the filter.
                          
                          All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                          URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                          implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                          document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                          filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                          `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                          this configuration error.

                                    If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
                                    is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
                                    `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
                                    side.
                                    
                                    The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
                                    wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.
                                    
                                    When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowMethods` field
                                    specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
                                    in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
                                    value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
                                    `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
                                    header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
                                    the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,
                                    instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway implementation may
                                    choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

                                    AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
                                    resource from the given `Origin`.
                                    
                                    The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
                                    takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.
                                    
                                    Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.
                                    
                                    Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
                                    available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
                                    assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
                                    origins. This may affect origin matching.
                                    
                                    The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
                                    wildcard characters behave as follows:
                                    
                                    * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                                      DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                                      `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                                      left of its position.
                                    * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.
                                    
                                    An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                                    from all `Origin`s are allowed.
                                    
                                    When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                    means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                    `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                    the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                    `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                    client.
                                    
                                    The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                    always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).
                                    
                                    If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                    the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                    cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                    403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                    the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                    Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.
                                    
                                    The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                    wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.
                                    
                                    When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowOrigins` field
                                    specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                                    in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                                    instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                                    `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                                    the client.

                                    A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response

                                    within this BackendRef, irrespective of how many endpoints are present
                                    within this BackendRef.
                                    
                                    If the referent cannot be found, this BackendRef is invalid and must be
                                    dropped from the Gateway. The controller must ensure the "ResolvedRefs"
                                    condition on the Route status is set to `status: False` and not configure
                                    this backend in the underlying implementation.
                                    
                                    If there is a cross-namespace reference to an *existing* object
                                    that is not allowed by a ReferenceGrant, the controller must ensure the
                                    "ResolvedRefs"  condition on the Route is set to `status: False`,
                                    with the "RefNotPermitted" reason and not configure this backend in the
                                    underlying implementation.

                                Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                
                                - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                  implementations must support core filters.
                                
                                - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                  are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                
                                - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                  specific vendors.
                                  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                  "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                
                                Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                
                                If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                        ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                        match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                        to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                        of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                        
                                        Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                        matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                        in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                        ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                        match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                        
                                        ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                        Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                        the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                          if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.
                          
                          For example, take the following matches configuration:
                          
                          ```

                          ```
                          
                          For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                          EITHER of the two conditions:
                          
                          - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                          - path prefix of `/v2/foo`
                          
                          See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                          match conditions that should be ANDed together.
                          
                          If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                          path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every

                          MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                          ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                          given to the match having:
                          
                          * "Exact" path match.
                          * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                          * Method match.
                          * Largest number of header matches.
                          * Largest number of query param matches.
                          
                          Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.
                          
                          If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:
                          
                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                          * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                            "{namespace}/{name}".
                          
                          If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                          to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                          criteria.
                          
                          When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                          parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                      match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                      as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                      the Gateway API.

                              retry attempts and is represented in Gateway API Duration formatting.
                              
                              For example, setting the `rules[].retry.backoff` field to the value
                              `100ms` will cause a backend request to first be retried approximately
                              100 milliseconds after timing out or receiving a response code configured
                              to be retryable.
                              
                              An implementation MAY use an exponential or alternative backoff strategy
                              for subsequent retry attempts, MAY cap the maximum backoff duration to
                              some amount greater than the specified minimum, and MAY add arbitrary
                              jitter to stagger requests, as long as unsuccessful backend requests are
                              not retried before the configured minimum duration.
                              
                              If a Request timeout (`rules[].timeouts.request`) is configured on the
                              route, the entire duration of the initial request and any retry attempts
                              MUST not exceed the Request timeout duration. If any retry attempts are
                              still in progress when the Request timeout duration has been reached,
                              these SHOULD be canceled if possible and the Gateway MUST immediately
                              return a timeout error.
                              
                              If a BackendRequest timeout (`rules[].timeouts.backendRequest`) is
                              configured on the route, any retry attempts which reach the configured
                              BackendRequest timeout duration without a response SHOULD be canceled if
                              possible and the Gateway should wait for at least the specified backoff
                              duration before attempting to retry the backend request again.
                              
                              If a BackendRequest timeout is _not_ configured on the route, retry
                              attempts MAY time out after an implementation default duration, or MAY
                              remain pending until a configured Request timeout or implementation
                              default duration for total request time is reached.
                              
                              When this field is unspecified, the time to wait between retry attempts
                              is implementation-specific.

                    each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that

                    first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                    route or gateway is modified.

                              * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
                              
                              Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a

                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.
                              
                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              differently based on the type of parent resource.
                              
                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                              select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.
                              
                              
                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the

                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.
                              
                              
                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly

                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                    Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host
                    header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations
                    MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while
                    performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
                    configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.
                    
                    Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
                    hostname with 2 notable exceptions:
                    
                    1. IPs are not allowed.
                    2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                       label must appear by itself as the first label.
                    
                    If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
                    must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
                    attached to the Listener. For example:
                    
                    * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                      least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                    * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                      one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                      `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
                      all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                      not match.
                    
                    Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                    as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                    both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
                    
                    If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
                    HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                    ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                    HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                    `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.
                    
                    If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                    match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
                    implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                    `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
                    
                    In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
                    overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
                    be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:
                    
                    * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                    * Characters in a matching hostname.
                    
                    If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for
                    HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.
                    
                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
                    
                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
                    
                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.
                    
                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
                    
                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                    
                    Some examples:
                    
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
                    
                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.
                    
                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
                    
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                      ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                      a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources

                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                      an API object (backendRefs).

                      backendRefs:

                          BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be
                          sent.
                          
                          Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                          how many are invalid.
                          
                          If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                          specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                          receive a 500 status code.
                          
                          See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                          HTTPBackendRef invalid.
                          
                          When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                          requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                          multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                          requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                          MUST receive a 500 status code.
                          
                          For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                          invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
                          choose how that 50 percent is determined.
                          
                          When a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready endpoints,
                          implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend instead.
                          If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above rules for 500 responses
                          MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.

                            If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the

                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the

                                          gateway must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header
                                          which value is present in the `AllowMethods` field.
                                          
                                          If the HTTP method of the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header
                                          is not included in the list of methods specified by the response header
                                          `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, it will present an error on the client
                                          side.
                                          
                                          The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header can only use `*`
                                          wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.
                                          
                                          When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowMethods` field
                                          specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one HTTP method
                                          in the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header. The
                                          value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is same as the
                                          `Access-Control-Request-Method` header provided by the client. If the
                                          header `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in the request,
                                          the gateway will omit the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header,
                                          instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. A Gateway implementation may
                                          choose to add implementation-specific default methods.

                                          AllowOrigins indicates whether the response can be shared with requested
                                          resource from the given `Origin`.
                                          
                                          The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
                                          takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.
                                          
                                          Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.
                                          
                                          Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
                                          available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
                                          assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
                                          origins. This may affect origin matching.
                                          
                                          The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
                                          wildcard characters behave as follows:
                                          
                                          * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                                            DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                                            `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                                            left of its position.
                                          * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.
                                          
                                          An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                                          from all `Origin`s are allowed.
                                          
                                          When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                          means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                          `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                          the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                          client.
                                          
                                          The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                          always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).
                                          
                                          If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                          the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                          cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                          403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                          the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                          Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.
                                          
                                          The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                          wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.
                                          
                                          When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowOrigins` field
                                          specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin
                                          in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header,
                                          instead of specifying the `*` wildcard. The value of the header
                                          `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is same as the `Origin` header provided by
                                          the client.

                                          A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                                          that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                                          The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:

                                          The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.
                                          
                                          When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,

                                          A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
                                          to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only

                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                              
                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                              
                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                      - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                        specific vendors.
                                        In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                        implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                        conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                        is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                        "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                      
                                      Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                      extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                      
                                      If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                      MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                      that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.
                                      
                                      Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                      must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.

                                              ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                              
                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                              
                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                          Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                          this rule.
                          
                          Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
                          they are specified.
                          
                          Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
                          any combination or order of filters that cannot be supported. If implementations
                          choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
                          that behavior.
                          
                          To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
                          consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
                          in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
                          a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
                          "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.
                          
                          Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:
                          
                          - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                          - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                          - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                            implementations.
                          
                          Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                          indicated in the filter.
                          
                          All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                          URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                          implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                          document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                          filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                          `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                          this configuration error.

                                    If any header name in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header
                                    does not recognize by the client, it will also occur an error on the

                                    The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header can only use `*`
                                    wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.
                                    
                                    When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowHeaders` field
                                    specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must specify one or more
                                    HTTP headers in the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response
                                    header. The value of the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is same as
                                    the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provided by the client. If
                                    the header `Access-Control-Request-Headers` is not included in the

                                    The `Origin` consists of a scheme and a host, with an optional port, and
                                    takes the form `<scheme>://<host>(:<port>)`.
                                    
                                    Valid values for scheme are: `http` and `https`.
                                    
                                    Valid values for port are any integer between 1 and 65535 (the list of
                                    available TCP/UDP ports). Note that, if not included, port `80` is
                                    assumed for `http` scheme origins, and port `443` is assumed for `https`
                                    origins. This may affect origin matching.
                                    
                                    The host part of the origin may contain the wildcard character `*`. These
                                    wildcard characters behave as follows:
                                    
                                    * `*` is a greedy match to the _left_, including any number of
                                      DNS labels to the left of its position. This also means that
                                      `*` will include any number of period `.` characters to the
                                      left of its position.
                                    * A wildcard by itself matches all hosts.
                                    
                                    An origin value that includes _only_ the `*` character indicates requests
                                    from all `Origin`s are allowed.
                                    
                                    When the `AllowOrigins` field is configured with multiple origins, it
                                    means the server supports clients from multiple origins. If the request
                                    `Origin` matches the configured allowed origins, the gateway must return
                                    the given `Origin` and sets value of the header
                                    `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` same as the `Origin` header provided by the
                                    client.
                                    
                                    The status code of a successful response to a "preflight" request is
                                    always an OK status (i.e., 204 or 200).
                                    
                                    If the request `Origin` does not match the configured allowed origins,
                                    the gateway returns 204/200 response but doesn't set the relevant
                                    cross-origin response headers. Alternatively, the gateway responds with
                                    403 status to the "preflight" request is denied, coupled with omitting
                                    the CORS headers. The cross-origin request fails on the client side.
                                    Therefore, the client doesn't attempt the actual cross-origin request.
                                    
                                    The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header can only use `*`
                                    wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is unspecified.
                                    
                                    When the `AllowCredentials` field is specified and `AllowOrigins` field
                                    specified with the `*` wildcard, the gateway must return a single origin

                                    to client-side scripts in response to a cross-origin request.
                                    
                                    A CORS-safelisted response header is an HTTP header in a CORS response
                                    that it is considered safe to expose to the client scripts.
                                    The CORS-safelisted response headers include the following headers:
                                    `Cache-Control`
                                    `Content-Language`
                                    `Content-Length`
                                    `Content-Type`
                                    `Expires`
                                    `Last-Modified`
                                    `Pragma`
                                    (See https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-response-header-name)
                                    The CORS-safelisted response headers are exposed to client by default.
                                    
                                    When an HTTP header name is specified using the `ExposeHeaders` field,
                                    this additional header will be exposed as part of the response to the
                                    client.
                                    
                                    Header names are not case sensitive.
                                    
                                    Multiple header names in the value of the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
                                    response header are separated by a comma (",").
                                    
                                    A wildcard indicates that the responses with all HTTP headers are exposed
                                    to clients. The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header can only
                                    use `*` wildcard as value when the `AllowCredentials` field is
                                    unspecified.

                                        ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                        match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                        to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                        of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                        
                                        Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                        matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                        in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                        ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                        match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                        
                                        ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                        Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                        the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                
                                - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by

                                  specific vendors.
                                  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                  "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                
                                Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                
                                If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                                        ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                        match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                        to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                        of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".
                                        
                                        Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                        matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                        in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                        ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                        match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                        
                                        ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                        Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                        the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                          if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.

                          ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                          given to the match having:
                          
                          * "Exact" path match.
                          * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                          * Method match.
                          * Largest number of header matches.
                          * Largest number of query param matches.
                          
                          Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.
                          
                          If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:

                                      entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.
                                      
                                      If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                      purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                      capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                      match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                      as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                      the Gateway API.
                                      
                                      Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                      themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                              For example, setting the `rules[].retry.backoff` field to the value
                              `100ms` will cause a backend request to first be retried approximately
                              100 milliseconds after timing out or receiving a response code configured
                              to be retryable.
                              
                              An implementation MAY use an exponential or alternative backoff strategy
                              for subsequent retry attempts, MAY cap the maximum backoff duration to
                              some amount greater than the specified minimum, and MAY add arbitrary
                              jitter to stagger requests, as long as unsuccessful backend requests are
                              not retried before the configured minimum duration.
                              
                              If a Request timeout (`rules[].timeouts.request`) is configured on the
                              route, the entire duration of the initial request and any retry attempts
                              MUST not exceed the Request timeout duration. If any retry attempts are
                              still in progress when the Request timeout duration has been reached,
                              these SHOULD be canceled if possible and the Gateway MUST immediately
                              return a timeout error.
                              
                              If a BackendRequest timeout (`rules[].timeouts.backendRequest`) is
                              configured on the route, any retry attempts which reach the configured
                              BackendRequest timeout duration without a response SHOULD be canceled if
                              possible and the Gateway should wait for at least the specified backoff
                              duration before attempting to retry the backend request again.
                              
                              If a BackendRequest timeout is _not_ configured on the route, retry
                              attempts MAY time out after an implementation default duration, or MAY
                              remain pending until a configured Request timeout or implementation
                              default duration for total request time is reached.

                              BackendRequest specifies a timeout for an individual request from the gateway
                              to a backend. This covers the time from when the request first starts being
                              sent from the gateway to when the full response has been received from the backend.
                              
                              Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                              completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                              instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                              the timeout can be set.

                              for example, if automatic retries are supported.
                              
                              The value of BackendRequest must be a Gateway API Duration string as defined by
                              GEP-2257.  When this field is unspecified, its behavior is implementation-specific;
                              when specified, the value of BackendRequest must be no more than the value of the
                              Request timeout (since the Request timeout encompasses the BackendRequest timeout).

                              Request specifies the maximum duration for a gateway to respond to an HTTP request.
                              If the gateway has not been able to respond before this deadline is met, the gateway
                              MUST return a timeout error.
                              
                              For example, setting the `rules.timeouts.request` field to the value `10s` in an
                              `HTTPRoute` will cause a timeout if a client request is taking longer than 10 seconds
                              to complete.
                              
                              Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                              completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST

                              This timeout is intended to cover as close to the whole request-response transaction
                              as possible although an implementation MAY choose to start the timeout after the entire
                              request stream has been received instead of immediately after the transaction is
                              initiated by the client.

                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a

                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

            ReferenceGrant identifies kinds of resources in other namespaces that are
            trusted to reference the specified kinds of resources in the same namespace
            as the policy.
            
            Each ReferenceGrant can be used to represent a unique trust relationship.
            Additional Reference Grants can be used to add to the set of trusted
            sources of inbound references for the namespace they are defined within.
            
            All cross-namespace references in Gateway API (with the exception of cross-namespace
            Gateway-route attachment) require a ReferenceGrant.
            
            ReferenceGrant is a form of runtime verification allowing users to assert
            which cross-namespace object references are permitted. Implementations that
            support ReferenceGrant MUST NOT permit cross-namespace references which have
            no grant, and MUST respond to the removal of a grant by revoking the access
            that the grant allowed.

                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.
                    
                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
                    
                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
                    
                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.
                    
                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
                    
                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                    
                    Some examples:
                    
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
                    
                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.
                    
                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
                    
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                          There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                          to the local namespace of the Route.
                          
                          Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                          boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.
                          
                          
                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                          routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                          any namespace to the Service.
                          
                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.

                          Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                          differently based on the type of parent resource.
                          
                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.
                          
                          
                          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                          Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                          the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.
                          
                          
                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                          document how/if Port is interpreted.
                          
                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                          interpreted.
                          
                          When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                          least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                          the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                          Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                    each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that

                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              differently based on the type of parent resource.
                              
                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and

                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                    Hostnames defines a set of SNI names that should match against the
                    SNI attribute of TLS ClientHello message in TLS handshake. This matches
                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:
                    
                    1. IPs are not allowed in SNI names per RFC 6066.
                    2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                       label must appear by itself as the first label.
                    
                    If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and TLSRoute, there
                    must be at least one intersecting hostname for the TLSRoute to be
                    attached to the Listener. For example:
                    
                    * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches TLSRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                      least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                    * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches TLSRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                      one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                      `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match. On the other
                      hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.
                    
                    If both the Listener and TLSRoute have specified hostnames, any
                    TLSRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                    ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                    TLSRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                    `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.
                    
                    If both the Listener and TLSRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                    match with the criteria above, then the TLSRoute is not accepted. The
                    implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                    `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                  description: |-
                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.
                    
                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
                    
                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
                    
                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.
                    
                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
                    
                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                    
                    Some examples:
                    
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
                    
                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.
                    
                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
                    
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                          differently based on the type of parent resource.
                          
                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

                          must match both specified values.

                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                          least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                            ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
                            namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
                            documentation for details.
                            
                            
                            When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                            honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.
                            
                            Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                            Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.
                            
                            If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                            backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                            protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.
                            
                            If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                            "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              differently based on the type of parent resource.
                              
                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

            UDPRoute provides a way to route UDP traffic. When combined with a Gateway
            listener, it can be used to forward traffic on the port specified by the
            listener to a set of backends specified by the UDPRoute.

                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.
                    
                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
                    
                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
                    
                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.
                    
                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
                    
                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                    
                    Some examples:
                    
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
                    
                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.
                    
                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.
                    
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.
                    
                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                      with "Core" support:

                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment

                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                            honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.
                            
                            Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                            Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.
                            
                            If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                            backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                            protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.
                            
                            If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                            "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a

                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                retryConstraint:
                  description: |-
                    RetryConstraint defines the configuration for when to allow or prevent
                    further retries to a target backend, by dynamically calculating a 'retry
                    budget'. This budget is calculated based on the percentage of incoming
                    traffic composed of retries over a given time interval. Once the budget
                    is exceeded, additional retries will be rejected.
                    
                    For example, if the retry budget interval is 10 seconds, there have been
                    1000 active requests in the past 10 seconds, and the allowed percentage
                    of requests that can be retried is 20% (the default), then 200 of those
                    requests may be composed of retries. Active requests will only be
                    considered for the duration of the interval when calculating the retry
                    budget. Retrying the same original request multiple times within the
                    retry budget interval will lead to each retry being counted towards
                    calculating the budget.
                    
                    Configuring a RetryConstraint in BackendTrafficPolicy is compatible with
                    HTTPRoute Retry settings for each HTTPRouteRule that targets the same
                    backend. While the HTTPRouteRule Retry stanza can specify whether a
                    request will be retried, and the number of retry attempts each client
                    may perform, RetryConstraint helps prevent cascading failures such as
                    retry storms during periods of consistent failures.
                    
                    After the retry budget has been exceeded, additional retries to the
                    backend MUST return a 503 response to the client.
                    
                    Additional configurations for defining a constraint on retries MAY be
                    defined in the future.

                        The effective overall minimum rate of retries targeting the backend
                        service may be much higher, as there can be any number of clients which

                    Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                    each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                    the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                    appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.
                    
                    Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                    an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                    which to namespace this status.
                    
                    Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                    the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                    use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                    that they are responsible for.
                    
                    Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                    MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                    and ControllerName fields combined.
                    
                    A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.
                    
                    If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                    Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                    on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                    here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                    additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                    the BackendTLSPolicy.

                      PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                      associated Ancestor.
                      
                      Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                      in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                      Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                      the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                      useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                      SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                      have a _very_ good reason otherwise.
                      
                      In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                      resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                      targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
                      
                      Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                      ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                      Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                      implementations.
                      
                      For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                      used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                      In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                      ancestor object referred to in this status.
                      
                      Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                      relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.
                      
                      This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                      with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                              Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              differently based on the type of parent resource.
                              
                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and

                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                    logical endpoints that are bound on this referenced parent Gateway's addresses.
                    
                    Listeners in a `Gateway` and their attached `ListenerSets` are concatenated
                    as a list when programming the underlying infrastructure. Each listener
                    name does not need to be unique across the Gateway and ListenerSets.
                    See ListenerEntry.Name for more details.
                    
                    Implementations MUST treat the parent Gateway as having the merged
                    list of all listeners from itself and attached ListenerSets using
                    the following precedence:
                    
                    1. "parent" Gateway
                    2. ListenerSet ordered by creation time (oldest first)
                    3. ListenerSet ordered alphabetically by “{namespace}/{name}”.
                    
                    An implementation MAY reject listeners by setting the ListenerEntryStatus
                    `Accepted`` condition to False with the Reason `TooManyListeners`
                    
                    If a listener has a conflict, this will be reported in the
                    Status.ListenerEntryStatus setting the `Conflicted` condition to True.
                    
                    Implementations SHOULD be cautious about what information from the
                    parent or siblings are reported to avoid accidentally leaking
                    sensitive information that the child would not otherwise have access
                    to. This can include contents of secrets etc.

                          Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                          may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria:
                          
                          * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                            a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                            a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                          * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                            alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                            example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.
                          
                          All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                          implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                          the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                          support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                          example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                          of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                          Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                          the following protocols:
                          
                          * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                          * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                          * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match at both the TLS and HTTP
                            protocol layers as described above. If an implementation does not
                            ensure that both the SNI and Host header match the Listener hostname,
                            it MUST clearly document that.

                          `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                          there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                          accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames

                          as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                          both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                          Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                          combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                          and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                          a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                          AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                          resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                          attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                          Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact
                          successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                          for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully
                          attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions.
                          
                          Uses for this field include troubleshooting Route attachment and
                          measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.
