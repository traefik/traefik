                                  The container image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided.
                                  Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
                                  cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                  to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                                  produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
                                  of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

                          URI as defined in the RFC:
                          1. IPs are not allowed. Currently a rule value can only apply to the
                          	  IP in the Spec of the parent .
                          2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.
                          	  Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and
                          	  :443 for https.
                          Both these may change in the future.
                          If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the
                          specified IngressRuleValue.
                          If multiple matching Hosts were provided, the first rule will take precedent.

            Service acts as a top-level container that manages a Route and Configuration
            which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a singular
            abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and which
            encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and
            team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the
            underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment
            orchestrates ReplicaSets), and its usage is optional but recommended.

            The Service's controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration
            and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.
