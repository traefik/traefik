    "AssociateVPCWithHostedZone": "<p>Associates an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone. </p> <important> <p>To perform the association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must already exist. You can't convert a public hosted zone into a private hosted zone.</p> </important> <p>Send a <code>POST</code> request to the <code>/2013-04-01/hostedzone/<i>hosted zone ID</i>/associatevpc</code> resource. The request body must include a document with an <code>AssociateVPCWithHostedZoneRequest</code> element.

    "ChangeResourceRecordSets": "<p>Create, change, update, or delete authoritative DNS information on all Amazon Route 53 servers. Send a <code>POST</code> request to: </p> <p> <code>/2013-04-01/hostedzone/<i>Amazon Route 53 hosted Zone ID</i>/rrset</code> resource. </p> <p>The request body must include a document with a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of the changes in a change batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements the intended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. </p> <p>For example, a change batch request that deletes the <code>CNAME</code> record for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If either the <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails, then both changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record continues to exist.</p> <important> <p>Due to the nature of transactional changes, you can't delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same change batch more than once, Amazon Route 53 returns an <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error.</p> </important> <note> <p>To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected.

If a resource set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. </p> </li> </ul> <p>The values that you need to include in the request depend on the type of resource record set that you're creating, deleting, or updating:</p> <p> <b>Basic resource record sets (excluding alias, failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record sets)</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Name</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Type</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>TTL</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Failover, geolocation, latency, or weighted resource record sets (excluding alias resource record sets)</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Name</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Type</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>TTL</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SetIdentifier</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Alias resource record sets (including failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted alias resource record sets)</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Name</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Type</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>AliasTarget</code> (includes <code>DNSName</code>, <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code>, and <code>HostedZoneId</code>)</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SetIdentifier</code> (for failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record sets)</p> </li> </ul> <p>When you submit a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, Amazon Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>PENDING</code>. When propagation is complete, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>INSYNC</code>. Changes generally propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers in a few minutes. In rare circumstances, propagation can take up to 30 minutes.

For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 <code>StatusCheckFailed</code> metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm.
