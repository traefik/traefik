  "service": "<p>Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real-time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and applications.</p> <p>CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and then use this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.</p> <p>In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.</p>",

    "DescribeAlarms": "<p>Retrieves the specified alarms. If no alarms are specified, all alarms are returned. Alarms can be retrieved by using only a prefix for the alarm name, the alarm state, or a prefix for any action.</p>",
    "DescribeAlarmsForMetric": "<p>Retrieves the alarms for the specified metric. Specify a statistic, period, or unit to filter the results.</p>",
    "DisableAlarmActions": "<p>Disables the actions for the specified alarms. When an alarm's actions are disabled, the alarm actions do not execute when the alarm state changes.</p>",

If you request more than 1,440 data points, Amazon CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. A period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds). Note that data points are not returned in chronological order.</p> <p>Amazon CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, Amazon CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.</p> <p>For a list of metrics and dimensions supported by AWS services, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html\">Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Dimensions Reference</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p>",
