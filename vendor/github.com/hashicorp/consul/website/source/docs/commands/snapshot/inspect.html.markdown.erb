# Consul Snapshot Inspect

Command: `consul snapshot inspect`

The `snapshot inspect` command is used to inspect an atomic, point-in-time
snapshot of the state of the Consul servers which includes key/value entries,
service catalog, prepared queries, sessions, and ACLs. The snapshot is read
from the given file.

The following fields are displayed when inspecting a snapshot:

* `ID` - A unique ID for the snapshot, only used for differentiation purposes.

* `Size` - The size of the snapshot, in bytes.

* `Index` - The Raft index of the latest log entry in the snapshot.

* `Term` - The Raft term of the latest log entry in the snapshot.

* `Version` - The snapshot format version. This only refers to the structure of
 the snapshot, not the data contained within.

## Usage

Usage: `consul snapshot inspect [options] FILE`

## Examples

```text
$ consul snapshot inspect backup.snap
