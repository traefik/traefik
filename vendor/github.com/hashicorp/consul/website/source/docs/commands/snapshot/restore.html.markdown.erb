# Consul Snapshot Restore

Command: `consul snapshot restore`

The `snapshot restore` command is used to restore an atomic, point-in-time
snapshot of the state of the Consul servers which includes key/value entries,
service catalog, prepared queries, sessions, and ACLs. The snapshot is read
from the given file.

Restores involve a potentially dangerous low-level Raft operation that is not
designed to handle server failures during a restore. This command is primarily
intended to be used when recovering from a disaster, restoring into a fresh
cluster of Consul servers.

If ACLs are enabled, a management token must be supplied in order to perform
snapshot a snapshot save.

## Usage

Usage: `consul snapshot restore [options] FILE`
