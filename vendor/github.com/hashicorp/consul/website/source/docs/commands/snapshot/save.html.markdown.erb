# Consul Snapshot Save

Command: `consul snapshot save`

The `snapshot save` command is used to retrieve an atomic, point-in-time snapshot
of the state of the Consul servers which includes key/value entries,
service catalog, prepared queries, sessions, and ACLs. The snapshot is saved to
the given file.

If ACLs are enabled, a management token must be supplied in order to perform
snapshot a snapshot save.

## Usage

Usage: `consul snapshot save [options] FILE`

## Examples

To create a snapshot from the leader server and save it to "backup.snap":

```text
$ consul snapshot save backup.snap
Saved and verified snapshot to index 8419
```

By default, snapshots are taken using a consistent mode that forwards requests
to the leader and the leader verifies it is still in power before taking the
snapshot.

After the snapshot is written to the given file it is read back and verified for
integrity.

To create a potentially stale snapshot from any available server, use the stale
consistency mode:

```text
$ consul snapshot save -stale backup.snap
# ...
```

This is useful for situations where a cluster is in a degraded state and no
leader is available. To target a specific server for a snapshot, you can run
the `consul snapshot save` command on that specific server.

Please see the [HTTP API](/api/snapshot.html) documentation for
more details about snapshot internals.
