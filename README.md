Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.
Traefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/), [Consul](https://www.consul.io/), [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/), [Rancher](https://rancher.com), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs), ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.
Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the _only_ configuration step you need.

## Overview

Imagine that you have deployed a bunch of microservices with the help of an orchestrator (like Swarm or Kubernetes) or a service registry (like etcd or consul).
Now you want users to access these microservices, and you need a reverse proxy.

Traditional reverse-proxies require that you configure _each_ route that will connect paths and subdomains to _each_ microservice. 
In an environment where you add, remove, kill, upgrade, or scale your services _many_ times a day, the task of keeping the routes up to date becomes tedious. 

**This is when Traefik can help you!**

Traefik listens to your service registry/orchestrator API and instantly generates the routes so your microservices are connected to the outside world -- without further intervention from your part. 

**Run Traefik and let it do the work for you!** 
_(But if you'd rather configure some of your routes manually, Traefik supports that too!)_

## Quickstart

To get your hands on Traefik, you can use the [5-Minute Quickstart](http://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v1.7/#the-traefik-quickstart-using-docker) in our documentation (you will need Docker).

Alternatively, if you don't want to install anything on your computer, you can try Traefik online in this great [Katacoda tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/traefik/deploy-load-balancer) that shows how to load balance requests between multiple Docker containers. 

If you are looking for a more comprehensive and real use-case example, you can also check [Play-With-Docker](http://training.play-with-docker.com/traefik-load-balancing/) to see how to load balance between multiple nodes.

## Web UI

You can access the simple HTML frontend of Traefik.

- Bug-fixes (e.g. 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.3) are released as needed (no additional features are delivered in those versions, bug-fixes only)

Each version is supported until the next one is released (e.g. 1.1.x will be supported until 1.2.0 is out)
