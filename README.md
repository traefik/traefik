Traefik (pronounced _traffic_) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.
Traefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/), [Consul](https://www.consul.io/), [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/), [Rancher](https://rancher.com), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs), ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.
Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the _only_ configuration step you need.

:warning: Please be aware that the old configurations for Traefik v1.x are NOT compatible with the v2.x config as of now. If you're running v2, please ensure you are using a [v2 configuration](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/).

## Overview

Imagine that you have deployed a bunch of microservices with the help of an orchestrator (like Swarm or Kubernetes) or a service registry (like etcd or consul).
Now you want users to access these microservices, and you need a reverse proxy.

Traditional reverse-proxies require that you configure _each_ route that will connect paths and subdomains to _each_ microservice. 
In an environment where you add, remove, kill, upgrade, or scale your services _many_ times a day, the task of keeping the routes up to date becomes tedious. 

**This is when Traefik can help you!**

Traefik listens to your service registry/orchestrator API and instantly generates the routes so your microservices are connected to the outside world -- without further intervention from your part. 

**Run Traefik and let it do the work for you!** 
_(But if you'd rather configure some of your routes manually, Traefik supports that too!)_

- Bug-fixes (e.g. 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.3) are released as needed (no additional features are delivered in those versions, bug-fixes only).

Each version is supported until the next one is released (e.g. 1.1.x will be supported until 1.2.0 is out).
